# Value of Information for Micro Storage Management in Smart Grids
Project for the course "Game Theory".
In this project, we study how to apply game theory methods in the context of Smart Grids. In particular, we consider a microgrid where each customer (or node) is provided with a certain amount of storage capacity. Our goal is to determine what is the optimal daily charge/discharge profile that a smart node has to apply in order to minimize the energy cost along with the global peak in the energy demand. We further investigate what happens if we also allow some nodes to have photovoltaic energy generators.
The complete report of the project can be found here.
